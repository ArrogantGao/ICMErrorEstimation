# Image Charge Method Error Estimation

This project is a collection of scripts and tools for estimating the error of the Image Charge Method (ICM) in the calculation of the electrostatic potential and forces.
The data and results are used in our paper: "Accurate Error Estimations in Ewald Summation for Electrostatics at Dielectric Planar Interfaces: Theory, Validation and Optimal Parameter Selection".
